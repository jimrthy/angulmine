# angulmine

This isn't *totally* a lame name simply because I'm doing a minecraft implementation
in AngularJS.

There's some vague reference to the Witchking of Angmar in there as well.


## How to


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.

Actually, everything interesting happens at http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html#/play

I really should fix that, but actually understanding the details of the way routing works
is a bit above and beyond.


### Running the app in production

Don't. This was intended strictly as an example of hacking together something I'm not
particularly familiar with.


## LICENSE

Right now, there really isn't one. The pieces of this code built on the Angular-Seed project
were released under the MIT license by google.

I'll probably release my pieces under something like the GPL when I have time to loop back around
to it.

Until then, let's just consider it Copyright 2013 James Gatannah.

It's not like there's anything in here that anyone sensible would really want to reuse yet
anyway.
