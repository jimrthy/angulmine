# angulmine

This isn't *totally* a lame name simply because I'm doing a minecraft implementation
in AngularJS.

There's some vague reference to the Witchking of Angmar in there as well.


## How to


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.

Actually, everything interesting happens at http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html#/play

I really should fix that, but actually understanding the details of the way routing works
is a bit above and beyond.


### Running the app in production

Don't. This was intended strictly as an example of hacking together something I'm not
particularly familiar with.
